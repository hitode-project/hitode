//! The two entries through which ntdll.dll leaves the guest.
//!
//! Wine's ntdll.dll calls into its Unix side, ntdll.so, through function
//! pointers that ntdll.so stores in it at startup: one for system calls and
//! one for Unix library calls. Here both are Hitode thunks, so a system call
//! is a single host call with no Unix side in between.
